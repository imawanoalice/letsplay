            Things that happen that day were bizarre, especially after strange explosive sparks painted the sky before you find yourself in an alternated version of the city where it is deserted and void of the things you were familiar with - like you are being transported into a parallel universe. There is no electricity and any indication of life yet.<br><br>
            In this new world, everything is free, it seems like a beautiful paradise but everything does come with a price which you have to pay by playing vicious games, over and over again. The only way for you to survive is by playing games with types and difficulties represented by a stack of cards.<br><br>
            When spades lead you to destruction, clubs to betrayal, diamonds to the fools, and hearts belong to the wicked. you will never know who will be back with you for the game because everything could happen for the sake of survival.<br><br>

        <P>
            1. All characters must come from a manga. We do not allow the usage of animated characters (games etc.)<br><br>
            2. Once you're inside the borders, all participants won't possess supernaturals abilities such as mutating, magic, super strength and many more. We're all an ordinary human here.<br><br>
            3. Profanity as a means to disclose your unsatisfaction and failure during the game is allowed, but you are strictly prohibited from using explicit language, media and anything related to sexual or pornographic content.<br><br>
            4. We do not tolerate any drama, ruckus or hostility among players. This concept of this agency and games are designed to instill trust issue, backstabbing and injustice ONLY for the sake of fun and being in line with the concept. If you find these unbearable to handle with no hard feelings. Unfortunately, we might not be the right fit for you.<br><br>
            5. Other than the guidelines above, we operate like any other closed agency out there; any kind of interaction with outsiders, exchanging other platforms or personal information, one head handling more than one account are strictly prohibited.<br><br>
            6. We do not encourage you to use fanarts to be edited whether for a video or a display picture. Always use proper credit whenever you want to use a fanart as your display picture.<br><br>
            7. You are obligated to mingle with everyone. After all, we're all the same here. You are not defined by your own franchise alone so make sure to create an equally friendly environment for everyone. 
        </P>
