            Things that happen that day were bizarre, especially after strange explosive sparks painted the sky before you find yourself in an alternated version of the city where it is deserted and void of the things you were familiar with - like you are being transported into a parallel universe. There is no electricity and any indication of life yet.<br><br>
            In this new world, everything is free, it seems like a beautiful paradise but everything does come with a price which you have to pay by playing vicious games, over and over again. The only way for you to survive is by playing games with types and difficulties represented by a stack of cards.<br><br>
            When spades lead you to destruction, clubs to betrayal, diamonds to the fools, and hearts belong to the wicked. you will never know who will be back with you for the game because everything could happen for the sake of survival.<br><br>
